## Staining Reagents
Staining reagents are essential in malaria microscopy to enhance the visibility of parasites within blood smears. 
These chemical dyes bind to cellular components, differentiating the parasite from red and white blood cells under a microscope. 
The figure below shows the proportion of the different reagents used in the studies.

## Smear Type
Smear preparation is a critical step in malaria microscopy, allowing for the visualization of parasites in stained blood samples. 
The two main types, thick and thin smears, serve different diagnostic purposes by optimizing parasite concentration and morphology.
